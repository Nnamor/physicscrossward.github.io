    <h3><font size="-1">In America's historic sequence of events, <strong><u>Theodore Roosevelt became president after the assassination of Wil
        liam McKinley.</u></strong> <br> Coming into his presidency, Theodore was known for the phrase <u><mark>"Square Deal"</mark></u> whi
        ch revolved around workers' rights and more regulation on massive businesses that participated in unfair practices. He was also the first
    president to come up with the idea that the government should exist to better the lives of the people instead of just controlling them
    He followed his ideas to a tee to the point that he became known as a <u><mark>trustbuster</mark></u>
    because of the amount of monopolies he cracked down on and seperated</font ><br> <img src="BullMooseParty.jpg" height="300" width="300"> </h3>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <font size="+5"> <u>The Bull Moose Party</u></font></p>
    <h3><font size="-1">Theodore Roosevelt created <mark><u>The Bull Moose Party</u></mark> in 1912 because he was unsatisfied with the renomination of his thought-to-be succesor,  William Howard Taft, 
    so he created an entirely new party so he could run against him and hopefully deny him of another term of presidency. Since Theodore was 
technically a republican, republican voters were split between him and another candidate named Woodrow Wilson, who would
go on to eventually win the election of 1912 and become president.</font><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br>><br> -by Nnamdi O.</h3>
