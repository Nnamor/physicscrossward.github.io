        Theodore promises to destroy so many trusts that people will call him a <u><mark>trustbuster!</mark></u>

    <h3><font size="-1">Theodore Roosevelt is a member and the founding father of the
        <mark><u>The Bull Moose Party</u></mark> because he is unsatisfied with the renomination of his thought-to-be succesor,  William Howard Taft,
        because he didn't live up to Theodore's expectations.
    So he created an entirely new party so he could run against him and, hopefully, deny him of another term of presidency. So why wouldn't you
        vote for him again? He has already bettered the lives of the citizens his previous term!</font> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  -by Nnamdi O.</h3>
